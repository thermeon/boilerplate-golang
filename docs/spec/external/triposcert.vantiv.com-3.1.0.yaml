        This is used to remove funds from an existing active Valutec gift card. 
        The Unload is typically associated with a payment transaction at the POS
        register when the merchant wishes to decrease the balance of the card
        due to a cash.  This method could also be used to adjust the balance due
        to a processing or customer service issue.  This method will result in
        the card being deactivated, though the card can be re-activated and used
        again.

        This endpoint deletes a payment account created with POST

        if the payment account was successfully deleted. Other HTTP status code
        responses indicate failure. If the payment account is not found, an HTTP
        status code 404 is returned. After a successful delete, this endpoint

        account purge typically happens within 48 hours. After 48 hours, this
